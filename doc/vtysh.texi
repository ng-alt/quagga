@chapter vtysh

@command{vtysh} is integrated shell of Zebra software.

To use vtysh please specify ---enable-vtysh to configure script.  To use
PAM for authentication use ---with-libapm option to configure script.

vtysh only search @value{INSTALL_PREFIX_ETC} path for vtysh.conf which
is vtysh configuration file.  Please not vtysh does not search current
directory for configuration file.  Because the file include user
authentication settings.

Currently vtysh.conf have only one command.

@example
!
username foo nopassword
!
@end example

This set user foo does not need password authentication for user vtysh.
With PAM vtysh use PAM authentication mechanism.

If vtysh compiled without PAM authentication, every user can use vtysh
without authentication.
